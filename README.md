# Spectrogram
This is an extension that plays and displays spectrograms of MP3, FLAC, and WAV audio files. Are you curious to see how your favorite songs' spectrograms look? ü¶ùü§™üí≠

![Spectrogram3.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanly-dev/VSCode-Spectrogram/refs/heads/main/media/vscodeignore/spec-sc4.png)

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `spectrogram.rgbColor`: Set color for rendering spectrogram
* `spectrogram.showDuration`: Show duration in treeview/file explorer. Disabling it would load file items faster if the directory has many audio files

## Known Issues

Autoplay policy prevents starting the song from selecting the audio file in the treeview.
